Simple HW program in Rust
========================

The program to write:
You are to write a program to interact with a data file of economic data. The data file has header information followed by the data. Each line of the data has a country name, the year represented by the data, amount of exports, balance of trade, population and geographical area of the world. Your program should offer the user choices of what to do. These choices include:

    Finding the top 5 exporting countries for a given year
    Finding the worst 5 exporting countries for a given year
    Finding the 5 countries with the best balance of trade for a given year.
    Finding the 5 countries with the worst balance of trade for a given year.
    Finding the 5 countries with the best ratio of exports to balance of trade for a given year.
    Finding the 5 countries with the worst ratio of exports to balance of trade for a given year.
    One other interesting choice. 

Use the input file ./data/exports.txt

Note: the data file doesn't have complete information. This assignment is just
about learning a new computer language.
